<p>Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with harmful impact on the activity of human or animal life. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and transportation systems.Poor urban planning may give rise to noise pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas</p>
<p>Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation noise, lawn care maintenance, nearby construction, or young people yelling (sports games). Noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations.The average noise level of 97.60 dB obtained exceeded the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas. Research suggests that noise pollution is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods.Documented problems associated with urban environment noise go back as far as ancient Rome.</p>
<p>High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss.While the elderly may have cardiac problems due to noise, according to the World Health Organization, children are especially vulnerable to noise, and the effects that noise has on children may be permanent.Noise poses a serious threat to a child’s physical and psychological health, and may negatively interfere with a child's learning and behavior,such as thinking screams or yelling are acceptable for any library, courtroom, church or classical music.</p>

Effect of noise pollution

<dl>
<u><dt>On Humans</u>
<dd>Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage physiological health. Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.Sound becomes unwanted when it either interferes with normal activities such as sleep or conversation, or disrupts or diminishes one's quality of life.Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 A-weighted, decibelsA comparison of Maaban tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.
<u><dt>Wildlife</u>
<dd><p>Noise can have a detrimental effect on wild animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. These effects then may alter more interactions within a community through indirect (“domino”) effects.Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.</p>
<p>An impact of noise on wild animal life is the Habitat of usable habitat that noisy areas may cause, which in the case of endangered species may be part of the path to extinction. Noise pollution may havejht caused the death of certain species of whales that beached themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military sonar.[20] (see also Marine mammals and sonar)</p>
